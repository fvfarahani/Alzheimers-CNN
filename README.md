# Building a CNN Model for Alzheimer's Diagnosis Using MRI

## Project Summary:
In this project, we demonstrate how to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier to predict whether an MRI scan of a patient shows signs of Alzheimer's disease or not. We use transfer learning, specifically the ResNet50 pre-trained model as our base model, and add custom layers on top to fine-tune the model for our specific task.

All the steps involved in the project can be accessed via the main.ipynb file.

## Data Source:
To start, download the Alzheimer's dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images) and extract the image data from the subfolders of the zip file. You'll need to create a Kaggle account to access the dataset.

## Project Steps:
Data Preparation
Setting up Directories and Classes
Data Augmentation (for Minor Label)

## Results:
### Model Performance
### Confusion Matrix
