# Building a CNN Model for Alzheimer's Diagnosis Using MRI

## Project Summary:
In this project, we demonstrate how to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier to predict whether an MRI scan of a patient shows signs of Alzheimer's disease or not. We use transfer learning, specifically the ResNet50 pre-trained model as our base model, and add custom layers on top to fine-tune the model for our specific task.

All the steps involved in the project can be accessed via the main.ipynb file.
